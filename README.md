👋 Hi there, I'm Parijat!

With over 6 years of experience in the software industry, I have honed my skills primarily in Python. As a skilled Django and Flask developer, my responsibilities stretch from meticulous documentation to comprehensive system design, and even to mentoring emerging talents - each day brings new and expanding challenges.

🎓 My alma mater is the University of Lethbridge, from where I obtained my Master's degree. [![Read Thesis](https://img.shields.io/badge/Read-Thesis-blue)](https://opus.uleth.ca/server/api/core/bitstreams/06cb3860-5c8f-4de5-8558-133fe128225b/content)


My GitHub is my own territory! Here, I make my own rules and bend them as I see fit, adapting and evolving in the fluid landscape of code and creativity.

**Favorite Colors:**
   - 🎨 My favorite colors are blue and black. However, a little hint: they are not the answers to any of my security questions, so keep guessing!

**Coding Philosophy:**
   - 💻 Keep it Simple, Stupid! [KISS Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)

**Tech Interests:**
   - 🌐 AgTech, FinTech, Quantum Computation, Blockchain, Dynamic Programming

**Learning and Growth:**
   - 📚 I am still a learner, always curious and excited to explore new technologies and paradigms in the ever-evolving world of software development.

**Work-Life Balance:**
   - 🧘‍♂️ "Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving." - Albert Einstein
  
     
     I am not an exception to this. When I am away from coding and all other tech-driven activities, I find serenity in sipping a cup of tea or walking in solitude. Sometimes, a random barking dog on the street gives me an adrenaline rush.

**Hobbies and Interests:**
   - 🎸 You will often find me strumming the strings of my guitar, crafting melodies that resonate with my inner rhythm. When I am not in front of the screen or holding my guitar, I feel a zeal to explore new places on my bike 🚴. Moreover, I cannot resist myself from embracing the adventure of hiking 🥾. Imbibing the freedom and beauty of the vast nature is always amaranthine to me.

**Personal Mantra:**
   - 🌟 “Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you will land among the stars.” ― Norman Vincent Peale

**Future Goals:**
   - 🚀 My dreams are not just daydreams. They come alive in my sleep, fueling my journey towards achieving them.

**As Easy As Pie:**
   - 🥧 Mnemonic giving 15 digits (3.14159265358979) of PI is "How I want a drink, alcoholic of course, after the heavy lectures involving quantum mechanics.

**Mistakes Can Happen:**
   - 🛠️ If you burn sugar, you get caramel. If you burn it at a high temperature with butter, you get toffee. That's how I see mistakes—everything happens for a reason, and mistakes show us the right path to follow.
