👋 Hi there, I'm Parijat!

With over 5 years of experience in the software industry, I have honed my skills primarily in Python. As a skilled Django and Flask developer, my responsibilities stretch from meticulous documentation to comprehensive system design, and even to mentoring emerging talents - each day brings new and expanding challenges.

🎓 My alma mater is the University of Lethbridge, from where I obtained my Master's degree. [![Read Thesis](https://img.shields.io/badge/Read-Thesis-blue)](https://opus.uleth.ca/server/api/core/bitstreams/06cb3860-5c8f-4de5-8558-133fe128225b/content)


My GitHub is my own territory! Here, I make my own rules and bend them as I see fit, adapting and evolving in the fluid landscape of code and creativity.

**Favorite Color:**
   - 🎨 My favorite colors are blue and black. However, a little hint: they are not the answers to any of my security questions, so keep guessing!

     I am not an exception to this. When I am away from coding and all other tech driven activities, I find serenity in sipping a cup of tea or walking in solitude. Sometimes a random barking dog on the street gives me an adrenaline rush.

**Hobbies and Interests:**
   - 🎸 You will often find me strumming the strings of my guitar, crafting melodies that resonate with my inner rhythm. When I am not in front of the screen or holding my guitar, I feel a zeal to explore new places on my bike 🚴. Moreover, I cannot resist myself from embracing the adventure of hiking 🥾. Imbibing the freedom and beauty of the vast nature is always amaranthine to me.
